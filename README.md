### Weekly Meeting: ###
 Fridays, 17:30 MDT, Zoom

### Vision Statement: ###
 Create a dynamic flashcard study app which implements a spaced-repetition algorithm to review user-input content

### Motivation: ###
 Traditional blocked learning (i.e., "cramming") is inefficient compared to spaced interleaved learning (Dunlosky et al., 2013; Kornell & Bjork, 2008; Mondria & Mondria-De Vries, 1994), but few flashcard apps incorporate spaced-repetition. Therefore, we want to create an easy-to-use app to enable users to study the content they want to study efficiently using spaced-repetition.
 
### Risks to Completion: ###
 * new language/working environment (Need to be more specific/concrete. Which languages? What working environment?)
 * no prior experience working with team members
 * no experience implementing web-based app with user input
 * no experience implementing spaced-repetition algorithms
 * _lack of _____ resources_
 * _More risks_

### Mitigation Strategies: ###
 * _Mitigation strategies for new language/working enviro_
 * Close communication via multiple channels (Email, Google Chat, Zoom, Google Docs, GitHub Projects)
 * _More strategies_

### Development Method: ###
Agile 
 * Scrum
   * Practices
     * Release planning
     * Sprint planning
     * Sprint review
     * Sprint retrospective
   * Deliverables
     * Product backlog
     * Sprint backlog
     * Burndown charts
     * Shippable functionality
 * Extreme Programming
   * Team-wide coding standard
   * Collective team ownership
   * Continuous integration via GitHub
   * Test-driven development
   * Simple design/code
   * Small, frequent releases
   * Sustainable work pace
   * Whole team understands whole project
 * Kanban
   * Visualize workflow
   * Limit work in progress
 * Agile Modeling
   * Requirements envisioning
   * Implement in priority order
   * Unified information source (GitHub)
   * Document late as possible
   * Just barely good enough artifacts
